# eti-dashboard × eti-api — Integration Reference

Every endpoint the admin dashboard needs, with real request/response shapes,
read from the implemented code (`accounts/`, `attendance/`).

**The dashboard is fully wired to this API** — all six routes run on live data.
This document is now the reference for changing that integration, and the
contract any other client should follow. Last verified **2026-08-12**.

Base URL: `<API_HOST>/api/` — **every path ends with a trailing slash**.
Without it Django 301-redirects, the POST body is dropped, and the request
silently becomes a GET.

All dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`, all times `HH:MM:SS`, domain fields are Tetun.
JSON in and out everywhere below (the punch endpoints are multipart, but the
dashboard never calls those).

> **The machine-checked contract is `docs/api-contract.md`.** It is generated
> from the URL resolver and the serializers, so where this document and that one
> disagree, that one is right. This file explains *how the dashboard uses* the
> API; that one states what the API *is*.

## 1. Authentication

| Method | Path | Body | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `auth/login/` | `{email, password}` | `{access, refresh, user}` — 401 on bad credentials |
| POST | `auth/refresh/` | `{refresh}` | `{access, refresh}` — **both new**; the old refresh is blacklisted |
| POST | `auth/logout/` | `{refresh}` (Bearer required) | 205 `{detail}` |
| POST | `auth/verify/` | `{token}` | 200 / 401 |
| GET | `auth/me/` | — | the profile (sidebar chip) |
| PATCH | `auth/me/` | multipart `foto` | replace your own photo |
| POST | `auth/troka-password/` | `{password_tuan, password_foun, password_konfirma}` | change **your own** password — see §1.1 |

`user` / `me` shape:

```json
{
  "id": 1, "numeru_id": 1, "email": "joao@eti-dili.tl",
  "naran_kompletu": "João Gaio", "kargu": "Diretor",
  "foto": "http://host/media/fotos/x.jpg",
  "role": "ADMIN", "role_display": "Administradór"
}
```

Rules the client must implement:

- Access token lives **15 min**, refresh **30 days** (idle timeout — each
  refresh returns a fresh pair). **Persist the new refresh token on every
  refresh** or the next one fails. Single-flight the refresh call; on 401
  refresh once, replay once, then force re-login (mirror
  `eti-mobile/lib/api.ts`).
- Admin-only routes below need an account with `is_staff=True` **or**
  `role="ADMIN"` — otherwise `403`.

### 1.1 Change your own password — `POST /api/auth/troka-password/`

For whoever is signed in, teacher or admin. **This is the only way an
administrator can change a password at all**: the roster's `reset-password`
refuses `rasik` (yourself) and `eh_admin` (another admin).

```json
{
  "password_tuan": "SenhaTuan-2026",
  "password_foun": "SenhaFoun-2026",
  "password_konfirma": "SenhaFoun-2026"
}
```

All three are required. It asks for the **old** password — unlike the admin
reset, which cannot, since an admin resetting a forgotten password never knows
it. Here the caller is changing their own credentials, so a borrowed unlocked
browser must not be enough to take the account.

**200**

```json
{
  "detail": "Password troka ho susesu.",
  "sesaun_taka": 2,
  "access": "eyJhbGciOi…",
  "refresh": "eyJhbGciOi…"
}
```

| Code | `code` | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | — | Changed |
| `400` | `password_presiza` | A field is missing |
| `400` | `password_la_hanesan` | `password_foun` ≠ `password_konfirma` |
| `400` | `password_hanesan_tuan` | The new password equals the old one |
| `400` | `password_fraku` + `erros[]` | Django's validators refused it |
| `403` | `password_tuan_sala` | The old password is wrong |
| `401` | — | Not signed in |

**Two things the client must do:**

1. **Store the returned `access` and `refresh`.** The change blacklists *every*
   refresh token for that account — `sesaun_taka` counts them — so the pair you
   were holding is dead. A fresh pair comes back in the body precisely so the
   dashboard does not bounce the admin to `/login` in the middle of the action.
   Persist both exactly as you do after `auth/refresh/`.
2. Other devices are signed out, which is the point: this is what someone does
   after losing a phone.

The new password is **never** echoed back — the caller typed it.

## 2. Teacher roster — `/api/profesor/` (admin)

### `GET /api/profesor/`

Plain array (no pagination envelope), ordered by `naran_kompletu`,
**deactivated accounts included** — filter/badge client-side on `is_active`.

**Since 2026-08-07 the roster lists `PROFESSOR` *and* `ADMIN` accounts**, so it
agrees with `ohin-hotu` / `hotu` / `istoria`, which always covered both. Badge
admins from `role` / `role_display` and hide the destructive buttons on those
rows — the API refuses `DELETE` and `reset-password` for them (`eh_admin`).

```json
[{
  "id": 3, "numeru_id": 1015, "email": "ana@eti-dili.tl",
  "naran_kompletu": "Ana Paula Ximenes", "kargu": "Profesóra Matemátika",
  "foto": null, "role": "PROFESSOR", "role_display": "Professór",
  "sexu": "FETO", "nu_kontaktu": "+670 7810 3345", "is_active": true,
  "nivel_edukasaun": "LICENCIADO", "nivel_edukasaun_display": "Licenciado",
  "area_estudu": "Gestão Informática",
  "disiplina_hanorin": "Sistema Base de Dados & Tec. Multimedia"
}]
```

**HABILITASAUN LITERÁRIA** on the printed roster is a heading spanning two
columns, not a column of its own — so it arrives as the pair
`nivel_edukasaun` + `area_estudu`. `nivel_edukasaun` is a closed set (render a
`<select>` from `konfig.nivel_edukasaun`); `area_estudu` is **free text**
(render an `<input list=…>` from `konfig.area_estudu_sujere`) because the
school's own sheet spells some areas more than one way and new areas appear.
All three are writable through POST and PATCH.

Use it to join `nu_kontaktu` into the Painel "seidauk marka" list and to fill
the teacher `<select>` on Prezensa/Relatóriu.

### `POST /api/profesor/`

```json
{ "numeru_id": 1015, "naran_kompletu": "Ana Paula Ximenes",
  "email": "ana@eti-dili.tl", "kargu": "Profesóra Matemátika",
  "nu_kontaktu": "+670 7810 3345", "sexu": "FETO" }
```

`numeru_id`, `naran_kompletu`, `email` required; the rest optional. Returns
**201** with the roster row **plus `password_inisial`** — shown exactly once,
unrecoverable afterwards (it is hashed at rest). Surface it in the modal with
a copy button before closing.

Errors: `400 {detail, code: "duplicate_numeru"}` or `"duplicate_email"` —
map onto the two existing toasts. Other validation errors arrive DRF-style
(`{field: [msg]}`).

### `PATCH /api/profesor/{id}/`

Any subset of the POST fields plus `is_active`. Deactivation is this soft
toggle and keeps the attendance history — prefer it. Returns the updated
roster row. Same duplicate codes as POST. `PUT` is 405.

A deactivated teacher drops out of `ohin-hotu` and `hotu` results (both
filter `is_active=True`), so Painel counts shrink accordingly.

### `DELETE /api/profesor/{id}/`

**Irreversible.** Removes the teacher and, by CASCADE, every monthly sheet,
day row and punch they ever made, plus their photo files on disk.

```json
{ "password": "<the signed-in admin's own password>" }
```

| Code | Body | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `204` | — | Deleted |
| `400` | `{detail, code: "password_presiza"}` | No `password` in the body |
| `403` | `{detail, code: "password_sala"}` | Wrong password |
| `403` | `{detail, code: "rasik"}` | Deleting your own account |
| `403` | `{detail, code: "eh_admin"}` | Target is an ADMIN — demote to PROFESSOR first |
| `404` | — | No such account |

The password is the **caller's**, not the target's. The dashboard asks for it
twice and only sends one copy; the server check is what actually holds, since
anything can call the endpoint directly.

### `POST /api/profesor/{id}/reset-password/`

A teacher who forgets their password has no self-service path — no e-mail
delivery, no reset link. They contact the admin, who sets a new one here and
hands it over.

```json
{ "password_foun": "SenhaFoun-2026", "password_konfirma": "SenhaFoun-2026" }
```

Both fields are required and **must be identical**. The server compares them
too, so a form that forgot to check cannot slip through.

| Code | Body | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | `{detail, sesaun_taka, profesor: {...}}` | Password changed |
| `400` | `{detail, code: "password_presiza"}` | A field is missing |
| `400` | `{detail, code: "password_la_hanesan"}` | The two fields differ |
| `400` | `{detail, code: "password_fraku", erros: [...]}` | Fails Django's validators (too short, too common, all numeric, too similar to the name/email). `erros` is the list of messages, already user-readable |
| `403` | `{detail, code: "eh_admin"}` | Target is an ADMIN |
| `403` | `{detail, code: "rasik"}` | Target is the caller |

**The new password is never returned** — the admin typed it, so the client
already has it. Show it once in a hand-over card with a copy button.

`sesaun_taka` is how many of that teacher's open sessions were revoked: a reset
blacklists every refresh token they had, so a phone already logged in stops
working and must sign in again with the new password.

## 3. Today, whole school — `GET /api/prezensa/ohin-hotu/` (admin)

Feeds all three Painel sections in one call.

```json
{
  "data": "2026-08-05", "loron": "Quarta-feira",
  "rezumu": { "total": 57, "marka_ona": 40, "seidauk_marka": 17 },
  "profesor": [
    { "profesor": { "id": 6, "numeru_id": 6, "naran_kompletu": "Martinho Martins",
                    "kargu": "Chefe Dep. TLP", "foto": "http://..." },
      "marka_ona": true,
      "prezensa": {
        "id": 91, "data": "2026-08-05", "loron": "Quarta-feira",
        "oras_dader_tama": "08:03:00", "oras_dader_fila": null,
        "oras_lorokraik_tama": null, "oras_lorokraik_fila": null,
        "status": "PRESENT", "status_display": "Prezente", "obs": "",
        "marka": [ { "kolumna": "ORAS_DADER_TAMA", "oras": "08:03:00",
                     "oras_orariu": "08:00:00", "atrazadu": true,
                     "foto": "http://host/media/prezensa/2026/08/x.jpg",
                     "latitude": "-8.552336", "longitude": "125.541603",
                     "distansia_metru": 12.4, "iha_eskola": true,
                     "sesaun": "DADER", "tipu": "TAMA",
                     "rejistu_iha": "2026-08-05T08:03:12+09:00" } ]
      } },
    { "profesor": { "...": "..." }, "marka_ona": false, "prezensa": null }
  ]
}
```

`prezensa: null` = has not punched today — that row is the "seidauk marka"
list. `profesor` here lacks `nu_kontaktu`; join it from the roster (§2).

## 4. Period grid — `GET /api/prezensa/hotu/` (admin)

The Prezensa grid and the Relatóriu source. One line per teacher per
**working day** (Sundays excluded), empty days included, teacher-major then
date-ascending.

Query parameters:

| Param | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `data=YYYY-MM-DD` | single day mode (response echoes `data` + `loron`) |
| `fulan=1..12&tinan=&semana=1..6?` | month / week mode, defaults to the current month (echoes `fulan`, `tinan`, `semana`) |
| `profesor=<id>` | narrow to one teacher |
| `marka=false` | omit nested punches (light grid load; fetch evidence per day via the full call) |

`data` and `fulan/tinan/semana` are mutually exclusive — `data` wins.

```json
{
  "fulan": 7, "tinan": 2026, "semana": null,
  "profesor": [
    { "profesor": { "id": 3, "...": "..." },
      "data": "2026-07-13",
      "prezensa": { "id": 91, "status": "LEAVE", "status_display": "Lisensa",
                     "obs": "Moras — atestadu médiku", "marka": [], "...": "..." },
      "marka_ona": false },
    { "profesor": { "...": "..." }, "data": "2026-07-14",
      "prezensa": null, "marka_ona": false }
  ]
}
```

Note the top-level `data` on every line — an empty day has `prezensa: null`,
so the date cannot live inside it. Count `loron servisu` from the rows
received; a full month for the whole school is ~1 500 lines.

Errors: `400 {code: "invalid_period"}` (bad date/fulan/tinan/semana),
`400 {code: "invalid_profesor"}` (non-numeric `profesor`).

Both `hotu` and `ohin-hotu` list **teachers and admins** (`role` PROFESSOR or
ADMIN, active only) — the director keeps a sheet like everyone else. Students
never appear.

### 4.1 One teacher, paper-sheet layout — `GET /api/prezensa/istoria/?profesor=<id>`

For a per-teacher view shaped exactly like the printed book (header
Naran/Kargu, one row per working day with the four time columns, week
numbers, monthly rezumu), admins may pass `?profesor=<id>` to `istoria/`:

```
GET /api/prezensa/istoria/?fulan=7&tinan=2026&profesor=6
```

Response: `{profesor, kargu, fulan, fulan_display, tinan, semana,
rezumu{loron_servisu, marka_ona, seidauk_marka, marka_total, atrazadu},
loron[]}` — each `loron[]` row carries `data`, `loron` (weekday), `semana`,
`sabadu`, the four `oras_*` columns, `status`, `status_display`, `obs` and
nested `marka`.
Without the param it returns the caller's own sheet; a non-admin passing it
gets `403`; unknown id → `400 {code: "invalid_profesor"}`.

## 5. Hand-written days — `/api/prezensa/status/` (admin)

> **Renamed 2026-08-06** — was `/api/prezensa/estadu/` with field `estadu`
> and Tetun values. The field is now `status` with **English stored values**
> (`PRESENT`, `ABSENT`, `LEAVE`, `MISSION`, `HOLIDAY`); the Tetun label lives
> in `status_display`. Update the URL, the payload key and every value string.

### `POST` — register LEAVE / MISSION / HOLIDAY / ABSENT over a range

```json
{ "profesor": 3, "status": "LEAVE",
  "husi": "2026-08-05", "too": "2026-08-07",
  "obs": "Moras — atestadu médiku" }
```

Server behaviour (do **not** re-implement client-side): skips Sundays,
creates the monthly sheet/day rows if absent, overwrites `status`/`obs` of
the days in range. `PRESENT` is not accepted — it can only come from a punch.

**201**:

```json
{ "detail": "Status rejistu ho susesu.", "profesor": 3, "status": "LEAVE",
  "husi": "2026-08-05", "too": "2026-08-07",
  "loron": ["2026-08-05", "2026-08-06", "2026-08-07"], "total": 3 }
```

Errors:

- `400 {code: "invalid_period"}` — `husi > too`, or range longer than a year.
- `400 {code: "invalid_profesor"}` — unknown teacher id.
- `400 {code: "iha_marka", loron: ["2026-08-06"]}` — **any day in the range
  already holds punches; nothing was written** (atomic). Show the conflicting
  dates; punches are evidence and cannot be buried under a leave.

### `DELETE` — return a day to "no record"

Body: `{"profesor": 3, "data": "2026-08-05"}` → **204**, the day row is gone.

- `404` — no row for that teacher/day.
- `400 {code: "iha_marka"}` — the day holds punches, or its status is
  PRESENT. Only hand-written days can be removed.

## 6. Rejecting a day's evidence — `/api/prezensa/{id}/rejeita/` (admin)

An administrator refuses the evidence behind a day: the day becomes `ABSENT`
and carries a reason, a note and who decided it.

```
POST   /api/prezensa/91/rejeita/    {"motivu": "FOTO_FALSU", "obs": "Foto la loos"}
DELETE /api/prezensa/91/rejeita/    (no body)
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `motivu` | `FOTO_FALSU` / `DISTANSIA_DOOK` / `HOTU_HOTU` | **yes** | |
| `obs` | string | no (default `""`) | the administrator's note |
| `marka` | integer | no | **validated, then discarded** — see the caveat below |

Both verbs return **200** with the full day object, so the grid can be updated
from the response without a refetch.

### The five keys this adds to every day object

Present on **every** `PrezensaSerializer` payload — the grid, the modal, the
reports — not just on rejected days:

| Key | Type | When not rejected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rejeita_motivu` | one of the three reasons, or `""` | `""` |
| `rejeita_motivu_display` | string or null — the Tetun label | `null` |
| `rejeita_obs` | string | `""` |
| `rejeita_husi_naran` | string or null — the admin's full name | `null` |
| `rejeita_iha` | ISO timestamp or null | `null` |

> **Renamed 2026-09-01** — was `rejeisaun_motivu`, `rejeisaun_obs` and
> `rejeisaun_motivu_display`. A hard cutover: the old keys are no longer sent.

`!!rejeita_motivu` is the single check for "is this day rejected". A rejected
day is `ABSENT` exactly like a hand-written absence, so without this check the
two are indistinguishable in the grid.

| code | Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `la_iha_marka` | 400 | POST on a day with no punches. A day nobody marked is made absent through `/api/prezensa/status/` instead |
| `marka_seluk` | 400 | the `marka` id does not belong to this day |
| `la_rejeita` | 400 | DELETE on a day that was never rejected here. A `LEAVE` day written through `/status/` cannot be flipped to `PRESENT` through this door |

### Caveat — what rejection does **not** do

Verified against the code, because it is commonly described otherwise:

- It is a property of **the day**, not of one punch.
- `marka` in the request is checked to belong to the day and then **never
  stored**. Nothing on the punch records that it was the one objected to.
- **Punch rows are untouched** — `Marka` has no soft-invalidation field.
- **The slot does not reopen.** The punch survives, so a second punch for the
  same session is refused with `duplicate`. Do not offer the teacher a
  "punch again" affordance after a rejection; it cannot succeed.

An open question about whether that is the intended design is recorded in
`api-contract.md` §6.


## 7. System info — `GET /api/konfig/` (any authenticated user)

For the Konfig panel — values now really come from the server.

```json
{
  "oras_dader_tama": "08:00:00", "oras_dader_fila": "12:00:00",
  "oras_lorokraik_tama": "13:30:00", "oras_lorokraik_fila": "17:30:00",
  "limite_sesaun": "13:00:00",
  "eskola_raiu_metru": 100.0, "eskola_obriga_fatin": true,

  "nivel_edukasaun": [
    {"value": "FINALISTA", "label": "Finalista"},
    {"value": "UNIVERSITARIA", "label": "Universitária"},
    {"value": "LICENCIADO", "label": "Licenciado"}
  ],
  "area_estudu_sujere": ["Gestão Informática", "Educação", "Económia"],
  "sexu": [{"value": "MANE", "label": "Mane"}, {"value": "FETO", "label": "Feto"}]
}
```

The three picklists are served here so the roster form never hardcodes what
the model owns — add a level in Django and the dashboard picks it up with no
frontend change.

Read-only; the school's coordinates are deliberately never included.

## 8. Evidence photos

Every punch carries **two** ways to reach its photo:

| Field | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `foto` | **displaying** — absolute URL straight to the file, no auth, fast |
| `foto_download` | **saving/exporting** — `GET /api/marka/{id}/foto/`, token required, streams the same bytes |
| `naran_foto_download` | the filename that download will use |

Punch photos are stored under a readable, predictable name:

```
prezensa/2026/08/punch_{numeru_id}_{naran-slug}_{checkin|checkout}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{sesaun}.jpg
prezensa/2026/08/punch_6_martinho-martins_checkin_2026-08-10_dader.jpg
```

`sesaun` (`dader`/`lorokraik`) is part of it because a teacher checks in twice a
day — name, direction and date alone are not unique. `numeru_id` leads so two
teachers whose names slugify alike cannot collide.

> **Deployment consequence.** A readable path is a guessable one, and
> `MEDIA_ROOT` is served with no authentication. **Do not expose `MEDIA_ROOT`
> publicly in production** — serve it privately and let clients fetch photos
> through `GET /api/marka/{id}/foto/`, which checks the token first. Left
> public, anyone who sees one photo URL can enumerate every teacher's selfie
> for any date.

Profile photos (`User.foto`) keep uuid names — they are replaced repeatedly,
and a recycled name once served the wrong person's picture.

`GET /api/marka/{id}/foto/` returns `200` with
`Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="…"` for the punch's own teacher or
any admin; `403 {code: "la_iha_permisaun"}` for another teacher; `401`
anonymous; `404 {code: "foto_lakon"}` when the row survives but the file does
not.

**Caveat:** `/media/` is served by Django only while `DEBUG=True`
(`core/urls.py`); in production the web server must serve `MEDIA_ROOT` or every
inline photo 404s. The download route works either way, since it streams
through Django.

## 9. Error handling summary

Errors are `400/403/404` with `{detail, code?, ...extra}`:

| code | Where | Dashboard reaction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `duplicate_numeru` / `duplicate_email` | roster POST/PATCH | field toast |
| `invalid_period` | `hotu`, `status` POST | fix pickers |
| `invalid_profesor` | `hotu`, `status` POST | shouldn't happen from UI |
| `iha_marka` | `status` POST/DELETE | show conflicting `loron`, offer to view the day |
| `la_iha_marka` | `rejeita` POST | the day has no punches to refuse — use `status` POST instead |
| `marka_seluk` | `rejeita` POST | the `marka` id belongs to another day |
| `la_rejeita` | `rejeita` DELETE | the day was not rejected here; keep the button hidden unless `rejeita_motivu` is set |
| `password_presiza` / `password_sala` | `profesor` DELETE | keep the modal open, clear both password fields |
| `rasik` | `profesor` DELETE / reset-password | "La bele … konta rasik.", close the modal |
| `eh_admin` | `profesor` DELETE / reset-password | admin rows are read-only; hide both buttons |
| `password_la_hanesan` | reset-password, troka-password | the two new-password fields differ — should be caught by the form first |
| `password_fraku` | reset-password, troka-password | show `erros[]` under the field |
| `password_tuan_sala` | troka-password | wrong current password — keep the modal open, clear that field only |
| `password_hanesan_tuan` | troka-password | the new password equals the old one |
| `token_not_valid` | refresh/logout | refresh → re-login |
| — (`403`) | any admin route | account lacks `EhAdmin`; send to login or hide UI |

`detail` messages are Tetun and user-displayable as-is.

## 10. Endpoints that exist but the dashboard does not call

| Endpoint | Why not |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/prezensa/checkin/` · `checkout/` | the teacher's own punch, multipart, mobile only |
| `GET /api/prezensa/ohin/` | self-scoped "my today"; the dashboard uses `ohin-hotu/` |
| `GET /api/prezensa/` · `{id}/` | self-scoped day rows — **no consumer at all** |
| `GET /api/lista-prezensa/` · `{id}/` | self-scoped monthly sheets — **no consumer at all** |
| `PATCH /api/auth/me/` | own photo; the dashboard *does* use this for the admin's own picture |

Listed so nobody goes looking for an admin variant that does not exist. Punch
times are deliberately read-only — there is no endpoint that edits a recorded
time — and there is no CSV/PDF endpoint, because Relatóriu builds both in the
browser from §4 rows.

**Naming note (2026-08-10):** the model methods behind the punch endpoints are
`Prezensa.checkin()` / `checkout()`, the button flags are `bele_checkin` /
`bele_checkout`, and the "you must check in first" error is `no_checkin`. The
older `clock_*` spellings are gone from the wire entirely.

## 11. Not implemented (yet)
